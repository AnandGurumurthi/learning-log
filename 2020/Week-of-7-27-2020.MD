## Security

This week the big focus is Security. Reading and watching videos about security. 

Started with [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjPF8yZ83Wo). This provided a good introduction to thinking about security. It shows you all the different things you need to think about when you are securing your application. 

Read about stateful and stateless [here](https://nordicapis.com/defining-stateful-vs-stateless-web-services/) . 

Then went through [this course](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/spring-security-authentication-authorization-layers-of-defense/) on Pluralsight which showed the different aspects of spring security. 

Since I have more than one application to get this flow working, I decided to use sso and have a separate authN / authZ server. 

Following all instructions [here](https://www.baeldung.com/sso-spring-security-oauth2), I was able to get the sample applications in the article setup and authenticated. 

THis uses [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) which is an Open Source Identity and Authentication Manager. I need to learn a lot more about this. I got a good intro to Keycloak [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duawSV69LDI) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJYy6Aq-PJ8).  

### Next steps: 

1. Understand how Keycloak is configured in the sample application. 
2. Replicate it for the applications I need. 
3. Wire all the pieces together. 
4. Give it a spin.
