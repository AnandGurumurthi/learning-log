## Spring WebSocket application that tracks the status of the migration

- Read about and setup a simple websocket application using Spring websocket
	- Websocket allows much faster communication between client and server than http
	- The goal for me is to use websockets to show the status of the migration from MongoDB to Postgres
- Code [here](https://github.com/AnandGurumurthi/mongo-to-pg-migrator)
- Key things to remember:
  - Most of the code is as-is from the [example](https://github.com/spring-guides/gs-messaging-stomp-websocket)
  - Spring provided a lot of what was needed for the setup of websocket connection including a sample html and js file
  - Changes I made:
    - [Combined](https://github.com/AnandGurumurthi/mongo-to-pg-migrator/blob/master/src/main/resources/static/app.js#L15) the connect and subscribe actions into a single user submit button
    - Updated the Controller class and made it as the starting point which will be triggered by the "start" button
    - The start button sends an empty message to the "/app/start-migration" endpoint which triggers the migration
      - TODO: Add some authentication here
    - Right now the "migration" step is a dummy for loop which runs from 1 to 5000 and sleeps 1 second when the number is divisible by 5. 
    - After each sleep, it calls the notification method on [StatusUpdater](https://github.com/AnandGurumurthi/mongo-to-pg-migrator/blob/master/src/main/java/com/learning/migrator/StatusUpdater.java) component. 
    - This component sends a message to this endpoint "/topic/migration-status"
    - The JS is subscribed to this endpoint and displays the message to the user.

## Spring REST application that exposes CRUD functionality as an API

- Most of the structure is as-is from what I learned in this [PluralSight course](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/spring-rest)
- Code [here](https://github.com/AnandGurumurthi/finance-tracking-rest-api)
- Key things to remember:
	- Spring REST provides a lot of the out-of-the-box configuration to setup a REST application
	- Spring JPA provides a lot of the out-of-the-box configuration to setup connections to database
	- Created a [Heroku postgres](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgresql) that will be used to store data
	- Right now it has [User](https://github.com/AnandGurumurthi/finance-tracking-rest-api/blob/master/src/main/java/com/financetracking/restapi/models/User.java) and [Transaction](https://github.com/AnandGurumurthi/finance-tracking-rest-api/blob/master/src/main/java/com/financetracking/restapi/models/Transaction.java) entitites
	- They both have services that connect to Postgres for CRUD operations
	- Added error handling in this [commit](https://github.com/AnandGurumurthi/finance-tracking-rest-api/commit/85da9757d36492dae20c152f6bfaa2a8964d79dd)
	- Added logging and swagger in this [commit](https://github.com/AnandGurumurthi/finance-tracking-rest-api/commit/34bb74fb717b3a9ec2b954ba144843af3651ced7)
		- [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) allows you to automatically generate API documentation with "Try it out" options as well
